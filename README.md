The `unikn` package provides some elements of the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/)'s corporate design in R.

See the official [brand information](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/create-online-and-print-media/corporate-design/) and the **Corporate Design Manual** [(pdf)](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/typo3temp/secure_downloads/57014/0/0143c03b80bd1fa99843c8f8686f806305928078/UKN_CD_Manual_150921.pdf) for details.

Colors
------

A distinctive and recognizable color scheme is the most obvious element of the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/)'s corporate design.

Our current definitions are based on the following sources:

-   Basic colors are specified in the **Corporate Design Manual** [(pdf)](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/typo3temp/secure_downloads/57014/0/0143c03b80bd1fa99843c8f8686f806305928078/UKN_CD_Manual_150921.pdf)

-   Additional colors are defined in an Excel file on [Colours for complex graphics](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/create-online-and-print-media/corporate-design/colours-for-complex-graphics/)

Note
----

We aim for an authentic representation of a highly-specified corporate design. While very rigid specifications may be appropriate for novices, they can also cause frustration in experts. Hence, we occasionally allow ourselves some liberties, mostly by imposing fewer restrictions. Examples include:

-   We use the term "color", rather than "colour".
